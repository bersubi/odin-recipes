<p>Manti is a type of dumpling mainly found in Turkish cuisine and Central Asian cuisine but also in West Asia, South Caucasus, and the Balkans. Manti is also popular among Chinese Muslims,[1] and it is consumed throughout post-Soviet countries, where the dish spread from the Central Asian republics.</p>
<p>The dumplings typically consist of a spiced meat mixture, usually lamb or ground beef, wrapped in a thin dough sheet which is then boiled or steamed. The size and shape of manti vary significantly depending on geographic location.[</p>
