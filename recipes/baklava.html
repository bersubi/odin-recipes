	<p>Baklava is a layered pastry dessert made of filo pastry, filled with chopped nuts, and sweetened with syrup or honey. It was one of the most popular sweet pastries of Ottoman cuisine.</p>
	<p>The pre-Ottoman origin of the dish is unknown, but, in modern times, it is a common dessert of Turkish, Iranian and Arab cuisines, and other countries of the Levant and Maghreb, along with the South Caucasus, Greece, Balkans, Somalia and Central Asia.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>

		<li>
			<h3>For the filling:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>1½ cups chopped nuts (walnuts, pistachios, or a combination)</li>
				<li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>For the layers:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>1 package (16 ounces) phyllo dough, thawed</li>
				<li>1 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>For the syrup:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>1 cup water</li>
				<li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
				<li>½ cup honey</li>
				<li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<h3>Prepare the Filling:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>In a bowl, combine the chopped nuts, sugar, and ground cinnamon. Set aside.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Prepare the Phyllo Dough:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
				<li>Trim the phyllo dough to fit the size of your baking dish if necessary.</li>
				<li>Place a damp cloth over the phyllo sheets to prevent them from drying out as you work.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Assemble the Layers:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Brush a layer of melted butter on the bottom of a baking dish (usually 9x13 inches).</li>
				<li>Place a sheet of phyllo dough in the dish and brush it with melted butter. Repeat until you have about 6 layers.</li>
				<li>Sprinkle a portion of the nut mixture evenly over the buttered phyllo layers.</li>
				<li>Continue layering phyllo and butter until you've used about half of the phyllo sheets.</li>
				<li>Add another layer of nuts.</li>
				<li>Finish layering the remaining phyllo sheets on top, brushing each layer with butter.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Cut and Bake:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Using a sharp knife, cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes before baking.</li>
				<li>Bake in the preheated oven for 40-50 minutes or until the baklava is golden brown.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Prepare the Syrup:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>While the baklava is baking, combine water, sugar, honey, cinnamon stick, and lemon juice in a saucepan.</li>
				<li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 15 minutes.</li>
				<li>Remove the cinnamon stick and let the syrup cool.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Pour the Syrup:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Once the baklava is out of the oven and still hot, slowly pour the cooled syrup over the hot baklava.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Allow to Cool:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Allow the baklava to cool completely before serving. This will help the syrup to soak into the layers.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Enjoy!</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Once cooled, use a knife to cut along the previously made lines, and serve the delicious baklava.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
