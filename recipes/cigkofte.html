	<p>Çiğ köfte or chee kofta is a kofta dish that is a regional specialty of southeastern Anatolia in Urfa. The dish is served as an appetizer or meze, and it is closely related with kibbeh nayyeh from Lebanese cuisine.</p>
	<p>Traditionally made with raw meat, there are vegetarian variations made with bulgur and in Urfa, a local meatless version is made with scrambled eggs. In Diyarbakır province locally prepared batches are sold by street vendors.</p>

	<ol>

			<h3>Prepare the Bulgur:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Place the fine Bulgur in a large mixing bowl.</li>
				<li>In a separate bowl, mix together the tomato paste, red pepper paste (if using), and hot water. Pour this mixture over the bulgur.</li>

			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Knead the Mixture:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Put on food-safe gloves and knead the mixture thoroughly for about 15-20 minutes until it becomes a cohesive and sticky dough. If the mixture is too dry, add a little more hot water.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Add Olive Oil:</h3>
